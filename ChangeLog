	* Made new release.

Fri Dec 10 2021 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Reorganized loop over 0x12 subleaves in do_real().  The old
	  code assumed validity was at least partially determined by a bitmask
	  in subleaf 0 (like for leaf 0x10), but that was wrong.  Thanks to
	  Scott Raynor for pointing this out.
	* cpuid.c: Added code for 0x12/(n>=2) subleaves to show invalid cases as
	  such, instead of resorting to a raw dump.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed missing loop over 0x1b subleaves in do_real().  This
	  might become necessary if more target identifiers are added.
	* cpuid.c: Added print_1b_n_target() to decode the MKTME target
	  identifier.
	* cpuid.c: Modified leaf 4 subleaf loop to include the terminating
	  "no more caches" subleaf.  Modified print_reg() to abbreviate
	  "no more caches" subleaves.
	* cpuid.c: Cleaned up loops for leaves 7, 0x14, 0x17, 0x18, 0x1d, 0x20
	  subleaves: max_tries (from subleaf 0) is available before the loop
	  starts.
	* cpuid.c: Modified leaf 0xb subleaf loop to exit for the right reason,
	  level type == 0.  Also, it includes the terminating "invalid" subleaf.
	  The similiar 0x1f leaf already did this.

	* cpuid.c: Removed __LARGE64_FILES from __CYGWIN__, per Brian Inglis'
	  request.

	  are resered names in C: __THING -> MaskTHING, _THING -> ShftTHING.
	  Brian Inglis says this was an actual practical problem in Cygwin.
	  This change makes the code less dense, but a bit easier to understand.

	  to other base addresses, to support hypervisors under other
	  hypervisors: IS_HYPERVISOR_LEAF(), print_hypervisor_*().
	* cpuid.c: Separated out get_hypervisor().  This ended up being

Tue Feb  2 2021 Jonathan Teh <jonteh@ntlworld.com>
	* From http://datasheets.chipdb.org/Cyrix/112ap.pdf (page 7, table 1):
	* cpuid.c: Cyrix family 4 model 4 should be MediaGX or GXi
	* cpuid.c: GXm is family 5, model 4
	* cpuid.c: Cyrix MediaGX is derived from the 5x86 and unrelated to the
	  WinChip C6. Based on Wikipedia, the MediaGXm was renamed the Geode GXm
	  after it was sold to National Semi but the CPUs appear to have
	  continued to be sold under the Cyrix vendor up to and including the
	  Geode GX1. Hence, I've simply duplicated the names from NSC model 4
	  into Cyrix.
	* cpuid.c: Model 9 for the WinChip 3 is moved to the Centaur section
	  [decode_synth_via()], from the datasheet page 3-11:
	  http://datasheets.chipdb.org/IDT/x86/WinChip3/winchip_3_datasheet.pdf
	* cpuid.c: The Cyrix CPU detection guide [112ap] also offers some
	  possible codenames from page 20, table 17 Cx486SLC/DLC/SRx/DRx (M0.5)
	  up to table 26 for the GXm.

	* cpuid.c: Updated 1/ebx "cpu count" to modern terminology: "maximum
	  addressible IDs for CPUs in pkg" to avoid user confusion.  It was a
	  reliable count of the number of CPUs for only a split second some time
	  around 2002.  Maybe.
	* cpuid.c: Updated 4/eax CPU & core count terminology in the same way.

Tue Feb 11 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>

	* cpuid.man: Added 336907 doc with 7/0/ecx/TME bit description.
	* cpuid.c: Removed LX* comment from 7/0/ecx/TME bit description.  It's
	  documented after all.

Tue Feb  4 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Clarified (0,6),(10,6) Comet Lake-U (synth).

Mon Feb  3 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Mon Feb  3 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Removed comments about (0,6),(8,14),10 contradiction.
	  Coreboot* removed the incorrect code claiming it was Coffee Lake D0.
	  The actual code already reflected this resolution.
	* cpuid.c: Removed now-redundant lines from decode_uarch_intel() for
	  the individual (0,6),(8,14) steppings.  They all say Kaby Lake now,
	  so they aren't necessary.
	* cpuid.c: Added (0,6),(4,14),8 Kaby Lake G0 and (0,6),(5,14),8
	  Kaby Lake-H A0 steppings to both (synth) and (uarch synth) that I found
	  in Coreboot*.  I realized I was worrying too much about them.  They are
	  at least wholly distinct steppings, so they don't constitute the
	  intra-stepping blurring that I saw with {Kaby,Amber,Whiskey,Comet}
	  Lake.  They are more akin to the already-existing Cascade Lake &
	  Cooper Lake steppings.  Perhaps those two new entries were just early
	  engineering samples for Kaby Lake.
	* cpuid.c: Added (0,6),(9,14),13 stepping to decode_uarch_intel.  The
	  fallback without a stepping is weak, and it should be avoided for
	  any actual known stepping.  (Added a comment too.)
	* Makefile: Changed my own Todd's Development rules to build on very old
	  systems, so that the executables will run at all on very old systems.
	* Makefile: Changed -Wextra to -W.  That isn't recommended on modern
	  gcc versions, but still works.  And it is necessary on really old
	  gcc versions, because -Wextra produces a hard error.

Sun Feb  2 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Sun Feb  2 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Makefile, cpuid.proto.spec: Added FAMILY.NOTES to the list of files to
	  be included in tarball & rpm doc directory.  That file still is messy,
	  but I reference it a lot, so maybe it will be useful to others too.

Sun Feb  2 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added old (synth) models from sandpile.org: AMD Elan SC400,
	  NSC Geode LX.
	* cpuid.c: Added some old (synth) and (uarch synth) die process numbers
	  from sandpile.org.
	* cpuid.c: Added stepping values from sandpile.org.
	* cpuid.c: sandpile.org calls (0,6),(4,6) "Crystalwell".  Arguably, that
	  is just the name of the L4 cache.  But even Intel's ARK calls these
	  CPUs "Crystal Well".  So I'm changing the name to "Crystal Well".  The
	  uarch still is Haswell, so that should clarify any confusion.
	* cpuid.c: sandpile.org calls (0,6),(4,7) "Brystalwell".  The situation
	  is similar, but Intel does not use that name at all.  I'm not renaming
	  these cores.

Sun Feb  2 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added leaf walking of the 0x20000000 (Intel Phi) range and
	  decoding of a single bit in 0x20000001, based on information in
	  sandpile.org.  I found only a vague hint about this in the Intel Xeon
	  Phi Coprocessor System Developers Guide, but no details.
	* cpuid.c: For the (0,11) family of Phi processors, placing them within
	  a K1OM family.  The (0,6) Phi cores are just Airmont-derived, so left
	  them alone.

Sat Feb  1 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Reverted Cedar Trail back to Cedarview.  (Atom uArch name vs.
	  Core name vs. Platform name vs. SoC name is very confusing.)

Sat Feb  1 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added Broadwell (0,6),(3,13) steppings based on Coreboot*.
	* cpuid.c: Added Haswell (0,6),(3,12) steppings based on Coreboot*.
	* cpuid.c: Added Haswell-ULT (0,6),(4,5),0 stepping based on Coreboot*.
	* cpuid.c: Added some Skylake (0,6),(4,14) steppings based on Coreboot*.
	* cpuid.c: Added some Skylake (0,6),(5,14) steppings based on Coreboot*.
	* cpuid.c: Added Kaby Lake-H (0,6),(9,14),9 stepping based on Coreboot*.
	* cpuid.c: Added Cannon Lake (0,6),(6,6) steppings based on Coreboot*.
	* cpuid.c: Added Apollo Lake (0,6),(5,12) A0 stepping based on Coreboot*.
	* cpuid.c: Added Gemini Lake (0,6),(7,10) A0 stepping, and corrected
	  R0 stepping, based on Coreboot*.
	* cpuid.c: Added Ice Lake-U/Y (0,6),(7,14) A0 stepping based on
	  Coreboot*, and disregarding inconsistent info from spec update.
	* cpuid.c: Added Tiger Lake (0,6),(8,12) A0 stepping based on Coreboot*.
	* cpuid.c: Added Elkhart Lake (0,6),(9,6) A0 stepping based on Coreboot*.
	* cpuid.c: Added Comet Lake (0,6),(10,6) steppings based on Coreboot*.
	* cpuid.c: Added Comet Lake-H/S (0,6),(10,5) steppings based on
	  Coreboot*.

Sat Feb  1 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added (uarch synth) decoding for (6,15),(0,0) Bulldozer,
	  based on engineering sample.
	* cpuid.c: Added (uarch synth) & (synth) (6,15),(6,0) Excavator Carrizo
	  and Toronto, based on instlatx64 samples.
	* cpuid.c: Added (uarch synth) decoding for (8,15),(0,0) Zen, based on
	  engineering sample.
	* cpuid.c: Added Zhaoxin (0,7),(1,15) based on example.
	* cpuid.c: Differentiate Zhaoxin ZhangJiang from VIA Isaiah [C7] in
	  (synth) and (uarch synth).  Sadly, this implies a need to use brand
	  information for (uarch synth).
	* cpuid.c: Addedd (synth) for VIA version of Zhaoxin ZhangJaing at
	  (0,7),(0,11).
	* cpuid.c: Added Westmere-EP A0 & B0 stepping (synth) based on instlatx64
	  sample & wikipedia article.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed bogus stepping in Centerton fallback (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Added (0,6),(5,5),10 Cooper Lake (synth) & (uarch synth),
	  based on Qemu.
	* cpuid.c: Added "AMD PRO A" as a 2nd string to detect AMD A-Series.
	* cpuid.c: Differentiate Raven Ridge from Great Horned Owl/
	  Banded Kestrel (synth), based on "Embedded" string in brand.
	* cpuid.c: Added Merlin Falcon as R-Series alternative everywhere
	  G-Series Brown Falcon appears.
	* cpuid.c: Added rules for EPYC Embedded to differentiate (synth) for
	  Snowy Owl and Naples, based on EPYC 3000 series.  Untested, because I
	  have no examples.

Fri Jan 31 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.man: Added instlatx64.atw.hu.
	* cpuid.man: Added -l and -s options.

Fri Jan 31 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added rudimentary (10,15) (synth) for AMD Zen 3.

Fri Jan 31 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.man: Added linux kernel note about intel-family.h.
	* cpuid.c: Added rudimentary Tremont (synth) & (uarch synth).
	* cpuid.c: Added tentative Ice Lake NNPI (synth) & (uarch synth).
	* cpuid.c: Added rudimentary (0,6),(10,6) Comet Lake [Coffee Lake]
	  (synth) & (uarch synth).

Fri Jan 31 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.man: Added Intel Microcode Update Guidance document.
	* cpuid.c: Removed br.generic check from dc (Core) query.  It was useful
	  in the Yonah era, but has been problematic since.  Instead, add a dG
	  (Generic) query and use that where needed for the Yonah CPUs.  And a
	  few other users of dc now use dG.
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) for Apollo Lake D0 (collision with B0/B1?) & E0.
	* cpuid.c: Generalized P4500 & U4500 (Arrandale/Clarkdale) (synth) names.
	* cpuid.c: Added Broadwell-DE V3 (synth) alternate stepping.

	* cpuid.c: Added Pentium G6900 (Clarkdale K0) (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Added Core i*-900 (Clarksfield) (query dc) (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Added E5-4600 (Ivy Bridge) (synth) names.
	* cpuid.c: Prefixed E to Jasper Forest Xeon (synth) names.
	* cpuid.c: Added Xeon E3-1200 (Kaby Lake) (synth) specific line.
	* cpuid.c: Added Xeon 6500 names to Beckon (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Generalized Pentium 900 (Sandy Bridge) (synth) names.
	* cpuid.c: Added Celeron T3000 / 900 / SU2300 (Wolfdale) (synth) names.
	* cpuid.c: Added Pentium T4000 (Wolfdale) (synth) names.
	* cpuid.c: Added Celeron M ULV 700 (Penryn) (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Correct query to dc for Sandy Bridge-E Core (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Added Pentium 1405 (Sandy Bridge-E) (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Added Xeon D-2100 (Skylake stepping 4) (synth) names.
	* cpuid.c: Added Core i9-7000X (Skylake-X) (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Changed case of x for SoFIA (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Simplified Westmere-EP Xeon (synth) names.
	* cpuid.c: Added Atom x*-A3900 (Apollo Lake) (synth) names.
	* cpuid.c: Added Rangeley core name to Atom C2000 (synth) names.
	* cpuid.c: Clarified that all (0,6),(4,15) CPUs are Broadwell-{E,EX}
	  in (synth) lines.
	* cpuid.c: Clarified that (0,6),(3,13) is Broadwell-U.
	* cpuid.c: For (0,6),(4,6) (synth), MRG* 2018-08-31 shows stepping 1,
	  so that must be the only known stepping: G0.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected Broadwell-Y Core M (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Added (0,6),(9,14),11 Coffee Lake Pentium & Celeron (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Corrected (0,6),(9,14),11 fallback (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Clarified transition from i*-8000 to i*-9000 at
	  (0,6),(9,14),12 stepping in (synth) lines.
	* cpuid.c: Added Puma 7 (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Generalized Pentium B900C (Ivy Bridge) (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Added Celeron G2000 (Haswell) (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Clarified Haswell-E (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Aded -4000 series to (0,6),(4,6) Core (synth) names.
	* cpuid.c: Added (0,6),(3,14) Ivy Bridge Celeron (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Corrected (0,6),(3,14) Cores as Ivy Bridge-E (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Differentiate i*-8700 and i*-7700 Kaby Lake (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Added (0,6),(8,14),9 Kaby Lake Pentium & Celeron (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Differentiate (0,6),(8,14),9 Kaby Lake-Y and Amber Lake-Y
	  (synth) with test for -8000 Series in brand name, because there seems
	  to be no other way to tell.
	* cpuid.c: Added XMM 7272 (SoFIA) (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Added Coffee Lake R0 Xeon (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Added Whiskey Lake W0 Pentium & Celeron (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Correct (8,14) (uarch synth) to just Kaby Lake once all
	  instances of Coffee lake had been eliminated from that family.  The
	  (9,14) family continues to include both Kaby Lake & Coffee Lake.

Fri Jan 31 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.man: Added Intel 600827 spec update.
	* cpuid.c: Generalized Bay Trail-M/D (synth) names and expanded them.
	* cpuid.c: Added Bay Trail-M/D D0/D1 (synth).

Thu Jan 30 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added VIA die processes for as many uarchs/cores as I could
	  find.

Wed Jan 29 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added comments about various Intel spec updates.
	* cpuid.man: Removed extra "315593" garbage line.
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) for Broadwell-E R0 stepping.
	* cpuid.c: Added stepping number for Apollo Lake B0/B1.
	* cpuid.c: Differentiate (synth) between Core & Xeon (0,6),(3,15)
	  Haswell.
	* cpuid.c: Differentiate (synth) between Core & Xeon (0,6),(2,12)
	  Westmere/Gulftown.
	* cpuid.c: Simplified more (synth) i*-*000 combinations.
	* cpuid.c: Removed duplicate slash in one Haswell (synth) line.
	* cpuid.c: Correct Itanium Merced model/stepping confusion.
	* cpuid.c: Added KX-5000 & KH-20000 to Zhaoxin WuDaoKou (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Added die proess to Zhaoxin WuDaoKou (uarch synth).
	* cpuid.c: Added Zhaoxin LuJiaZiu (0,7),(3,11) model (synth) &
	  (uarch synth).

Tue Jan 28 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Differentiate (synth) between Bay Trail Pentiums, Celerons
	  & Atoms.
	* cpuid.c: Differentiate (synth) between Braswell Pentiums & Celerons.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected (synth) steppings for Braswell.
	* cpuid.c: Add J3000 series to (synth) for Braswell.
	* cpuid.c: Remove Pentium & Celeron items from {Kaby,Coffee,Comet} Lake
	  Core (synth).  I'd already created separate items for those, but
	  missed removing the names from the Core-specific line.

Mon Jan 27 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Mon Jan 27 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Changed 0x8000001e/ecx to display nodes per processor in N-1
	  notation, after receiving confirmation from AMD that this is correct.

Sat Jan 25 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Fixed spelling of (size synth).  I meant to always have
	  "synth" at the end of synthesized fields, and had that one flipped
	  around.
	* cpuid.c: Clarified AVX512_VNNI: neural network instructions.
	* cpuid.c: Clarified AVX512_VBMI2: byte VPCOMPRESS, VPEXPAND.
	* cpuid.c: Clarified AVX512_BF16: bfloat16 is a data format, not an
	  instruction.
	* cpuid.c: Added 7/0/edx md-clear feature, found from Xen & Qemu
	  hypervisors.
	* cpuid.c: Added 0x80000008/ebx ppin feature, found from Xen hypervisor.
	* cpuid.c: Added 0x40000001/eax (KVM) flags.
	* cpuid.c: Got rid of the Transmeta 0x80860001/eax family description,
	  which I missed when I got rid of all 1/eax families.  It wasn't so
	  egregious, but it wasn't very valuable either.  The Transmeta Crusoe
	  name already was in the (synth) leaf.
	* cpuid.c: Wrote a version of bits_needed() that uses __builtin_clz
	  with gcc 3.4 and later.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed bug with old asm-based bits_needed() function when the
	  input value was 0.

Sat Jan 25 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Further clarified descriptions in 0x8000001f leaf, based on
	  text in AMD64 Architecture Programmer's Manual, Vol 3, 3.28.  I had
	  missed these new fields in my earlier pass through the manual.
	* cpuid.c: Added comments for more undocumented fields, noting where
	  the information came from, particularly SKC*, LX*, and sandpile.org.
	* cpuid.c: Changed case of new descriptions.
	* cpuid.c: Created Synth_Family() & Synth_Model() macros based on
	  print_1_eax & SKC's AMD_Family() macro.
	* cpuid.c: Added (family synth) and (model synth) to 0x80000001/eax,
	  (AMD and Hygon variants), just like for 1/eax.
	* cpuid.c: Added Castle Peak B0 stepping (synth), now that I know the
	  stepping name.
	* cpuid.c: Changed 0x80000008/ebx "RDPRU instruction" field.
	* cpuid.c: Clarified 0x80000020 leaf descriptions based on AMD 55803 PPR.
	* cpuid.c: Modified print_apic_synth's bit width computations to reflect
	  change in terminology (core => thread, CU => core) in AMD Family 17h.
	* cpuid.man: Updated 54945 PPR name, using newer doc from
	  developer.amd.com.
	* cpuid.man: Added 55803 PPR, found by URL provided by AMD.
	* cpuid.man: Updated sandpile.org URL.

Sat Jan 25 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Selectively applied changes from Smita Koralahalli
	  Channabasappa's patch: "Add PQoS feature to CPUID utility and display
	  subleaf 1 for leaf 0x80000020 in the raw CPUID data."
	* cpuid.c: Renamed fields which no longer are Intel-specific:
	  RDT-CMT/PQoS cache monitoring and RDT-CAT/PQE cache allocation.

Fri Jan 24 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Shortened 0x8000001f leaf descriptions to <= 40 chars.

Fri Jan 24 2020 Smita Koralahalli Channabasappa <Smita.KoralahalliChannabasappa@amd.com>
	* cpuid.c: Add AMD Secure Encryption feature bits to CPUID utility.
	* cpuid.c: Update CPUID utility with additional AMD specific features.
	* cpuid.c: Handle naming issues of cores->threads at register
	  80000008_ecx and compute unit->core at register 8000001e_ebx for
	  families greater than 16h.  Retains previously assigned names if
	  families are lesser than or equal to 16h.  Family values are
	  determined by adding family number and extended family
	  number(80000001_eax[8:11] + 80000001_eax[20:27]) as described in PPR
	  under CPUID_Fn00000001_eax.

Wed Jan 22 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Wed Jan 22 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: In print_80000001_ebx_amd, removed two checks for
	  __M(val_1_eax) >= _XM(0) + _M(0).  Yes, gcc, I know that "comparison
	  of unsigned expression >= 0 is always true", and I also know even a
	  half-assed optimizer will get rid of it, so I preferred clarity.  But
	  people freak out if the compiler emits any warnings, no matter what
	  crazy -W options the've chosen.  So I'm removing them.
	* cpuid.c: Changed a bunch of ccstring return types to cstring.  The
	  extra const in ccstring was meaningless for return types, but it
	  caused a ton of additional -Wignored-qualifiers warnings.  No grousing
	  about those warnings; they seem legit.
	* Makefile: Added -Wextra, so I'll see these before people complain
	  about them in the future.

Tue Jan 21 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Changed Cannon Lake to Palm Cove when talking about uarch.
	* cpuid.c: Added extra (0,6),(8,14),12 (unknown type) fallback.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed (0,6),(8,14) Whiskey Lake typo.
	* cpuid.c: Added i*-9000 names to (0,6),(9,14) Coffee Lake CPUs.

Mon Jan 20 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Sun Jan 19 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Fixed (synth) decoding of Kaby Lake vs. Coffee Lake (and
	  their myriad "optimizations").
	* cpuid.c: Correctly (synth) decoding of Comet Lake, which was wildly
	  wrong.
	* cpuid.c: Treating Whiskey Lake, Amber Lake, and Comet Lake as distinct
	  uarchs just causes absurd "Coffee Lake / Whiskey Lake / Amber Lake /
	  Comet Lake" uarch strings.  Instead, call all of them Coffee Lake, but
	  turn off the core_is_uarch flag.  This ends up treating the other 3 as
	  core names within the Coffee Lake uarch, which seems clearer.
	* cpuid.c: Renamed Ice Lake to Sunny Cove when talking about uarch.
	* cpuid.c: Renamed Tiger Lake to Willow Cove when talking about uarch.
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) differentiation between Whiskey Lake (U line)
	  & and Amber Lake (Y line).
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) differentiation between Whiskey Lake (8000
	  Series) and Comet Lake (10000 Series).
	* cpuid.c: Separated (synth) for Goldmont Plus into Pentium & Celeron.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed Moorefield (synth) to say Z3500 instead of Z3400.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed (0,6),(5,5),7 to Cascade Lake-X.  Core names should be
	  as specific as possible (in contrast to uarch names).
	* cpuid.c: added (0,6),(2,7) Atom Z2000 Medfield (synth) based on
	  example found on instlatx64.
	* cpuid.c: Renamed Cedarview (SoC name) to Cedar Trail (core name).
	* cpuid.c: Added (0,6),(1,15) Havendale/Auburndale (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Added VIA (0,6),(0,15) Esther C5J (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Added VIA Nano steppings to (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Added AMD Ryzen vs. EPYC (synth) differentiation to
	  Castle Peak / Rome.
	* cpuid.c: Separated Mullins into Mullins (tablets) and Beema (desktop).
	* cpuid.c: Separated Kabini into Kabini (desktop) and Kyoto (servers).
	  Also added Temash for A-Series, although they're all mixed up with
	  Kabini.
	* cpuid.c: Added AMD (6,15),(3,8) Godavari (synth) decoding.
	* cpuid.c: Added AMD (2,15),(0,3) Griffin (synth) decodings.
	* cpuid.c: Removed duplicate junk code for AMD (1,15),(0,2) which
	  prevented the 3 and 10 steppings from being used.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected some AMD (0,6),(0,8) Duron Applebred (synth) names.
	* cpuid.c: Added AMD DG02SRTBP4MFA based on example found on instlatx64.

Fri Jan 17 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Merged 0xb and 0x1f leaf code, much like what Len Brown of
	  Intel suggested a year ago.  I don't know why I didn't just do that in
	  the first place.  Merged field names look more like the 0x1f names,
	  because I thought they were clearer.
	* cpuid.c: Removed type descriptions from "--- level ---" sub-headers.
	  Intel docs clarify the levels and types are not related.
	* cpuid.c: Got rid of the ridiculously overloaded 1/eax family
	  descriptions.  That information is nearly useless in isolation and
	  described much better in the new (uarch synth) field.
	* cpuid.c: Also got rid of 0x80000001/eax family descriptions.  It
	  wasn't nearly as bad, but still better to use the (uarch synth) field.
	* cpuid.c: Because I removed that family information, also updated the
	  decode_uarch* functions with information about older CPU makers'
	  information.
	* cpuid.c: Added vendor name to (uarch synth).
	* cpuid.c: Fixed 4 and 0x8000001d leaf descriptions to say that the
	  values are in "minus 1" notation.  Steven Noonan hinted that there was
	  something to check here, and there was.
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth size) field to the 4 and 0x8000001d leaves to
	  compute the cache size, also based on a hint from Steven Noonan.
	* cpuid.c: Added preliminary Zhaoxin decoding based on limited
	  information I could find.
	* cpuid.c: Added missing uarch names to decode_uarch_intel().
	* cpuid.c: Added note about P5 Tillamook CPUs.
	* cpuid.c: Added some more die process values.

Thu Jan 16 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Thu Jan 16 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added decode_uarch*() and moved the uarch suffixes there from
	  print_synth*().  print_synth_intel() and print_synth_amd() now call
	  that function to get the suffixes.
	* cpuid.c: Added print_uarch_synth() to display just those suffixes.
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) decoding for Itanium Poulson & Kittson.
	* cpuid.c: Correct (synth) decoding for Itanium Montecito, Millington,
	  Montvale, Tukwila.
	* cpuid.c: Cleaned up AMD [Excavator] core names.
	* cpuid.man: Added some missing Intel spec updates.

Wed Jan 15 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added "(family synth)" and "(model synth)" to do the combined
	  values used by the linux kernel and AMD.  That is:
	     Family = XF + F
	     Model  = (XM << 4) + M
	* cpuid.c: Hunt down the fallback (synth) decodings that just list tons
	  of different possible meanings, all copied from the more specific
	  lines above them.  They almost always are wrong; if they were right,
	  the more specific tests would've detected them.  So, they're pure
	  guesswork.  Replace them with "(unknown type)", which is more honest.
	* cpuid.c: Simplified Intel Xeon Scalable descriptions.
	* cpuid.c: Eliminated reiteration of i3-XXXX, i5-XXXX, i7-XXXX CPUs,
	  using i*-XXXX instead.
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) decoding for Core i*-4000U seen in the wild.
	* cpuid.c: Correct missing = symbol in 0x80000001/eax transmeta leaf.
	* cpuid.c: Added [K6], [K7], [K8] (synth) clarifications for AMD K8 CPUs.
	* cpuid.c: Added (6,15),(6,5) (synth) based on sample from Alexandros
	  Couloumbis.
	* cpuid.c: Added AMD "*-Series" queries for the various latters and
	  (synth) rules to use them.  Added more rules for AMD architectures
	  that used this nomenclature.
	* cpuid.c: Changed dO query to sO.

Wed Jan 15 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Clarified (synth) for each microarchitecture to include
	  process-neutral microarchitecture names too:
	  {P6}           = (Pentium Pro, Klamath, Deschutes, Katmai, Coppermine,
	                    Tualatin, Mendocino, Cascades)
	  {Netburst}     = [Willamette, Northwood, Prescott, Cedar Mill]
	  {P6 Pentium M} = (Banias), [Dothan, Yonah]
	  {Core}         = [Merom, Penryn]
	  {Nehalem}      = [Nehalem, Westmere]
	  {Sandy Bridge} = (Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge)
	  {Haswell}      = (Haswell, Broadwell)
	  {Skylake}      = (Skylake, Kaby Lake, Coffee Lake, Whiskey Lake,
	                    Amber Lake, Cascade Lake, Comet Lake, Cooper Lake,
	                    Cannon Lake)
	  {Sunny Cove}   = (Ice Lake, Tiger Lake)
	  The similarities are hazy in places.  But this seems useful to help
	  people who, for example, don't know "Cedar Mill", but do know
	  "Netburst".  Also the number of Skylake-related architecture names
	  exploded, and not all "Lake" names belong to Skylake, so this helps to
	  clarify.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected (synth) for Tolapai to 90nm process.

Tue Jan 14 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Clarified Arrandale & Clarkdale as [Westmere].
	* cpuid.c: Clarified Bloomfield, Gainestown & Beckton as [Nehalem].
	* cpuid.c: Added [Merom] clarification to a couple CPUs that missed it.
	* cpuid.c: Added [Cedar Mill] clarification to a couple CPUs that missed
	  it.
	* cpuid.c: Clarified Dothan, Stealey, Crofton & Tolopai as [Dothan].
	* cpuid.c: Clarified Yonah, Sossaman as [Yonah].
	* cpuid.c: Did not clarify Banias as [Banias] because it appears there
	  are no non-Banias chips based on it.
	* cpuid.man: Added handy wiki pages about microarchitectures.

Mon Jan 13 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added 6/eax HW_FEEDBACK flag.
	* cpuid.c: Added 7/0/ecx ENQCMD flag.

	* cpuid.c: Added 0x80000008/ebx SSBD flags from AMD white paper.
	* cpuid.c: In 7/0/edx leaf, clarified PCONFIG as an instruction.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth detection for Cyrix MediaGX (circa 1997 SoC).
	* cpuid.c: Added 7/0/ecx TME flag, discovered in the linux-5.5-rc6
	  kernel source.
	* cpuid.c: Added 0x80000008/ebx additional STIBP always on flag,
	  discovered in the linux-5.5-rc6 kernel source.
	* cpuid.man: Added AMD SSBD white paper.
	* cpuid.man: Added linux kernel note and clue on what to look for.

Sun Jan 12 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added Matisse B0 stepping based on sample from Steven Noonan.
	* cpuid.c: Removed redundant dR lines from Pinnacle Ridge.  (They could
	  come back if I see an EPYC based on Pinnacle Ridge, but they're
	  redundant now.)

Sun Jan 12 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Sun Jan 12 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Makefile, cpuid.proto.spec: Added INSTALL_STRIP to allow disabling the
	  install -s option.  This makes rpmbuild & find-debuginfo.sh happy,
	  because they can find the cpuid debug information and create the
	  cpuid-debuginfo rpm.
	* Makefile: Updated release target to move debugsource rpms too.

Sun Jan 12 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added 0x40000004 leaf for Xen hypervisor.
	* cpuid.c: Added 0x40000005 leaf for Xen hypervisor.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed errors with static ccstring arrays that were not large
	  enough to hold NULLs for all reserved bit field values.
	* cpuid.c: Added AMD's CMT "compute unit" concept to print_apic_synth
	  by adding that architectural level above the "cores" level, which
	  relects AMD's portrayal.  This level is displayed only if it is
	  present.
	* cpuid.c: Added some undocumented synth decodings found on
	  https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/amd/cpuid.  Not everything there makes
	  sense, so I didn't take everything.  Marked with comments.
	* cpuid.c: Added architecture tags to Intel synth decodings:
	  [Willamette], [Northwood], [Prescott], [Merom], [Penryn], [Nehalem],
	  [Westmere].  After that, Intel dropped the hyper-specific code names
	  in favor of suffix letters.
	* cpuid.c: Added architecture tags to Intel synth decodings: [Bonnell],
	  [Saltwell], [Silvermont], [Airmont], [Goldmont], [Goldmont Plus].
	  Intel continues to use hyper-specific names for Atom CPUs.

Sat Jan 11 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Makefile: Added -Wimplicit-fallthrough -Wunused-parameter options.
	* cpuid.c: Clarified 4/edx WBINV/INVD flag.

	  mitigate speculative execution exploits.
	* cpuid.c: Cleaned up output of 0x10 subleaves.
	* cpuid.c: Added 0x12/0/ebx CPINFO for #CP exceptions in enclave.
	* cpuid.c: Properly display 0x18 sub-leaf number.
	* cpuid.c: Added leaf 0x1f V2 Topology logic to decode_mp_synth() and
	  print_apic_synth().  I have no physical examples, so I only could test
	  with artificial input files.
	* cpuid.c: Added 3-way and 6-way associativity to 0x80000006 and
	  0x80000019 leaves.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed incorrect fallthrough in switch for "41322 3.74:
	  table 16".
	* cpuid.c: Fixed incorrect fallthrough's in switch for Family 12h tables.
	* cpuid.c: Added UNUSED macro to make newer gcc's shut up about unused
	  formals.  (They have one complaint if the name is omitted, and another
	  complaint if it's specified but unused.  There's just no pleasing gcc.)
	* cpuid.c: Added break after usage() to make gcc shut up about a
	  nonexistent fallthrough (even though it was marked with NOTREACHED).
	* cpuid.c: Added missing newlines to all the print_2_byte Cyrix/VIA
	  special cases.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed print_f_0_edx: QoS monitoring was in 0xf/0 bit 1, not
	  bit 0.
	* cpuid.c: Added print_40000001_edx_kvm and appropriate call.
	* cpuid.c: For 0x80000001/ebx amd, display PkgType for all family 16h
	  or higher systems, even if no specific BrandId breakdown is known.
	  Added encodings from AMD BKDG and PPR documents.

Sat Jan 11 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added proper synth decoding for Atom C3000 (Denverton).

	* Formatting changes & URL removal from Jeffrey Walton's SunOS patch.
	* Prettification of Thomas Friebel's 0x40000003 leaf fix: while loop.
	* Reverted print_header() to use !raw (personal preference of mine).
	* Format changes to & rearrangement of fanjinke's Hygon patch.

Fri Jan  3 2020 Thomas Friebel <friebelt@amazon.de>
	* Fixed bug that skipped half the subleaves in the 0x40000003 hypervisor
	  leaf.
	* Fixed contradictory try logic in print_header() for leaf 0x40000003.
	* Fixed to use 0x40000003/ebx for high 32 bits of vtsc_offset,
	  instead of using eax for both high & low 32 bits.

	* cpuid.c: Added decoding of 0x10/3 subleaf.

Sat May 26 2018 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Fixed 7/ecx spelling error: intruction.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed main spelling error: unrecogized.

Sat May 19 2018 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Sat May 19 2018 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added some more fields reported by Stefan Kanthak, after
	  tracking down some documentation that explains them:
	* cpuid.c: Added 7/ecx bit 7: CET_SS and 7/edx bit 20: CET_IBT fields.
	  So far, the only documentation for these is Control-flow Enforcement
	  Technology Preview (334525), section 8.2 Feature Enumeration.
	* cpuid.c: Added 7/ecx bit 16: 5-level paging.  So far, the only
	  documentation for this is 5-Level Paging and 5-Level EPT White Paper

	  Encrypted Virtualization API Version 0.16 Technical Preview
	  (55766 Rev 3.06).
	* cpuid.man: Added 54945 & 55766 docs.

Thu Apr 19 2018 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Wed Apr 19 2018 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Fixed various bugs reported by Stefan Kanthak:
	* cpuid.c: Fixed bug in print_2_meaning: 0x49 normal & special cases.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed bug in print_2_meaning: 0x63 additional 2M/4M, 4-way,
	  32 entries item.
	* cpuid.c: Collapsed print_2_meaning into print_2_byte so that the
	  prefix and CONT are known in one place.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed bug in print_2_byte: 0x7d is not sectored.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed bug in print_2_byte: 0xc2 is 4K, not 4M.
	* cpuid.c: Changed 6/ecx bit 0 to "hardware coordination feedback".
	* cpuid.c; Changed 7/ebx bit 3 to "BMI1 instructions".
	* cpuid.c: Change 7/ebx bit 12 to RDT-M.
	* cpuid.c: Change 7/ebx bit 15 to RDT-A.

	* cpuid.c, cpuid.man: Attribute whitepaper to Shih Kuo.

Wed Jun 22 2017 Lars Wendler <polynomial-c@gentoo.org>
	* cpuid.c: recent glibc versions no longer automagically include
	  sysmacros.h headers. This needs to be done by the source files itself
	  now.

Fri Mar  3 2017 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added missing SDBG bit to 1/ecx leaf.

Sun Jan 22 2017 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c: Use __cpuid_count macro for "cpuid" instruction if possible.
	  This macro is present in gcc 4.3.0 and later, and works around the fact
	  that the cpuid instruction writes on the PIC register.  This is only
	  important when compiling PIC/PIE.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for Intel Knights Landing B0.  The Intel
	  docs still don't specify the stepping numbers, but all examples seen
	  so far have stepping number 1, and so far B0 is the only stepping.
	* cpuid.c: Added new synth decodings for Intel Kaby Lake.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed synth decodings for AMD Steamroller.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed synth decodings for AMD Jaguar.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decodings for AMD Puma.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decodings for AMD Excavator.
	* cpuid.c: For (6,15),(0,2) Piledriver processors, detect FX series
	  and report it as Vishera instead of Abu Dhabi/Seoul/Delhi.
	* cpuid.c: Added general microarchitecure names for AMD (e.g.
	  Piledriver) in addition to specific core names (e.g. Trinity) for
	  later generation processors.  If I have trouble remembering these,
	  it seems likely other people do too.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for Quark X1000.
	* cpuid.c: Added Intel Atom Z2760 (Clover Trail).
	* cpuid.c: Added extra synth decodings for some Sandy Bridge processors.
	* cpuid.c: Added extra synth decodings for some Ivy Bridge processors.
	* cpuid.man: Added new & missing spec updates & revision guides.
	* FUTURE: Cleaned this up somewhat.

Mon Dec  5 2016 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Removed stale len variable from do_file().

Thu Dec  1 2016 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Wed Nov 30 2016 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Fixed bugs in the subleaf walks for 0x8000001d (AMD cache
	  information) and 0x40000003 (Xen hypervisor information) because the
	  code for them was under wholly the wrong loops.  Thanks to Brice
	  Goglin for detecting this and working out the cause of the bug.

Wed Nov 16 2016 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Updated comments referencing 325462 Table 35-1 to also

	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.man: Added 334663 & 334820 spec updates.

Sun Nov 13 2016 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Fixed bug reported by Andrew Cooper where, in do_real, for
	  the 0xd leaf, the lower half of the valid bit set for XSS should've
	  used 0xd/1/ecx instead of 0xd/1/eax.  Sadly, this bug affects raw
	  dumps too.
	* cpuid.c: Added -l/--leaf and -s/--subleaf options to cause cpuid
	  to dump just the specified leaf and subleaf.  If -s/--subleaf is not
	  specified, it is assumed to be 0.  The intended purpose for this is
	  to display raw dumps of not-yet-supported leaves, or to workaround
	  bugs like the above.

Sat Nov 12 2016 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: In bits_needed, add a further check for !defined(__ILP32__),
	  which should help with building a 32-bit version of cpuid on a 64-bit
	  system.

Sat Nov 12 2016 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Made editorial changes to Piotr Luc's patches (spelling,
	  capitalization, register order, comments, etc.).
	* cpuid.c: Added AVX512DQ, AVX512IFMA, AVX512BW, AVX512VL, and CLWB
	  decoding to 7/ebx.
	* cpuid.c: Added AVX512VBMI to 7/ecx.
	* cpuid.c: Added print_f_0_edx to show L3 cache QoS monitoring support.
	* cpuid.c: Added total & local bandwidth monitoring to 0xf/1/edx.
	* cpuid.c: Added 0x15/ecx nominal core crystal clock decoding.
	* cpuid.c: In print_17_0_ebx, corrected reversed scheme encodings.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for Xeon D-1500 (Broadwell-DE) Y0
	  stepping.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding comment about Braswell D1 stepping, but
	  its stepping number isn't documented.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for (0,6),(8,14) Kaby Lake processors.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for Apollo Lake processors.
	* cpuid.c: Added vague synth decoding for (0,6),(9,14) Kaby Lake
	  processors.
	* cpuid.c: Re-sorted (0,6),(5,7) Knights Landing to correct position.
	* cpuid.c: Re-sorted (0,6),(5,15) Goldmont to correct position.

Sat Oct 27 2016 Piotr Luc <Piotr.Luc@intel.com>
	* cpuid.c: Add AVX512_4VNNIW & AVX512_4FMAPS flags.

Sun Aug 14 2016 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* Makefile: Added clean rules to remove tarballs & rpm's with other
	  version numbers.

Sun Aug 14 2016 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuinfo2cpuid: Added a script that takes input from a /proc/cpuinfo
	  file and converts it into suitable input to cpuid.  The information
	  that cpuid is capable of producing based on this very limited input
	  information is slight, but apparently there is interest in getting the
	  synthesized (synth) leaf from this.  There isn't much value in using
	  it with an actual /proc/cpuinfo file on the local system, because just
	  allowing cpuid to read the local cpuid info will provide better
	  output.  But it could be useful for interpreted saved /proc/cpuinfo
	  files from another system.  I slapped together the basic logic, and
	  Jirka Hladky turned it into a proper perl script, with actual options,
	  a help screen, and even documentation.  I then made some changes to
	  give it some more uniform indentation, whitespace, and such.  And to
	  give Jirka Hladky more credit, since his contribution to the script is
	  larger than my own.
	* Makefile: Added rules to generate cpuinfo2cpuid.man from the =pod data
	  in the script.
	* Makefile: Added cpuinfo2cpuid & cpuinfo2cpuid.man to the released
	  materials.
	* cpuid.proto.spec: Added cpuinfo2cpuid & cpuinfo2cpuid.1.gz to released
	  materials.

Sun Aug 14 2016 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Changed instances of Kb to KB.  In print_2_meaning, changed
	  an instance of 4k to 4K.

Sat Aug 13 2016 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added 7/ebx SGX & FDP_EXCPTN_ONLY flags.

	* cpuid.c: Added d/0/eax MPX state field.
	* cpuid.c: In print_d_0_eax, split MPX and AVX-512 all_or_none fields
	  into their component parts.  Also added IA32_XSS PT state.
	* cpuid.c: In print_d_n_ecx, clarify XCR0 as user state and IA32_CXX as
	  supervisor state.
	* cpuid.c: In print_d_n, add MPX and PT features.
	* cpuid.c: Renamed leaf 0x10 to Intel's new name.  Corrected totally
	  bogus interpretation of subleaf 0.
	* cpuid.c: Generalize subleaf 0x10/1 to also include 0x10/2, and
	  provide new Intel correct names for each.
	* cpuid.c: Added 0x14/0 PTWRITE & power event trace.
	* cpuid.c: Added description for leaf 0x12 (SGX Capability) and all its
	  subleaves.
	* cpuid.c: Added descriptionf or leaf 0x17 (SoC vendor) and its
	  subleaves.

	* cpuid.c: Corrected Atom Z8000 (Cherry Trail) with correct model, per
	  changes in its spec update.
	* cpuid.c: Change the (0,6),(5,14) Skylake descriptions to be more vague
	  to reflect the larger set of existing processors now.
	* cpuid.c: Add actual information for the (0,6),(4,14) Skylake
	  processors.

	* cpuid.c: Added vague mentions of Goldmont (0,6),(5,12) and (0,6),(5,15)
	  based on 325462 Table 35-1.
	* cpuid.c: Add Atom S1200 (Centerton) under (0,6),(3,6) thanks to an
	  example provided by Jirka Hladky.
	* cpuid.c: Added Eden to the list of possible meanings of VIA
	  (0,6),(6,13).  An example provided by Daniel Wyatt shows that they
	  sometimes use the simple Eden brand for this architecture.

	  above changes.
	* cpuid.c: Made -f - operate on stdin.

Wed Jun 22 2016 Alan Cox <alan@lxorguk.ukuu.org.uk>
	* cpuid.c: Added out-of-memory checks to strregexp.

Mon Oct 19 2015 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Updated cpuid.man's list of information sources with new sources used

	* cpuid.c: Added vague synth decodings for a few more future processor
	  models from Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's
	  Manual (325462), Table 35-1.

Thu Oct 15 2015 Hubert Chrzaniuk <hubert.chrzaniuk@intel.com>
	* cpuid.c: Decode new leaf 2 cache descriptors: 6a, 6b, 6c, 6d.
	* cpuid.c: added synth decoding for Knights Landing.
	  [NOTE FROM Todd Allen: There is no datasheet or spec update for
	  Knights Landing yet, but Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software
	  Developer's Manual (325462), Table 35-1 mentions that it will have the
	  family & model (0,6),(5,7).

Sat Jun  6 2015 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.man: Added 325462 manual.
	* cpuid.c: Added new & missing decodings for: 4/ecx, 6/eax, 7/ebx, 7/ecx.
	* cpuid.c: Overhauled handling of 0xd leaf, based on new and more
	  extensive information in the Intel CPUID documentation, particularly
	  on how to decide which leaves are valid.  The approach functions
	  correctly for the subset described in the AMD documentation, too.
	  This overhaul includes information on the XSAVEC, XGETBV, and
	  XSAVES/XRSTORS instructions.
	* cpuid.c: Renamed 0xf leaves to include "Monitoring".
	* cpuid.c: Added 0x10 leaves for QoS Enforcement.
	* cpuid.c: Added new leaf 2 cache meanings: 0x1d, 0x24, 0xa0, 0xc3.
	* cpuid.c: Added missing i7 synth decoding for (0,6),(3,14).
	* cpuid.c: Corrected Atom Z3000 model & stepping which were bafflingly
	  wrong: (0,6)(3,5),1 -> (0,6)(3,7),8.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected other Bay Trail stepping names for Celeron/Pentium
	  N and J series.
	* cpuid.man: Added references to a bunch of new Intel manuals.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for Intel Xeon Phi (Knights Corner).

	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for Intel i7-5000 Extreme (Haswell R2).
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for Intel Atom Z8000 (Cherry Trail).
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for Intel Pentium/Celeron N3000
	  (Braswell).
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for Intel i7 5th gen (Broadwell).
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for Intel E3-1200 v4 (Broadwell).
	* cpuid.c: Added Xeon E5-4600 to synth decoding for other Sandy Bridge
	  E5 processors (it was omitted accidentally).
	* cpuid.c: Added Pentium D 9xx Processor to synth decoding for Presler
	  D0 (it was omitted accidentally).

Fri Mar 21 2014 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Deal with 0-width PKG_width fields in print_apic_synth(),
	  for CPUs where the SMT_width + CORE_width >= 8.  This happens on
	  Xeon Phi chips.

Wed Feb 12 2014 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added CLFLUSHOPT instruction field to leaf 7, ebx.
	* cpuid.c: Added Processor Frequency Information leaf (0x16).

Tue Feb 11 2014 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Makefile: Added src_tar rule.

Tue Feb 11 2014 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Made changes to allow building and running on kFreeBSD.  This
	  started out as a patch from Andrey Rahmatullin, but I refactored it.
	  The changes to disable the cpuid kernel support are protected by a
	  USE_CPUID_MODULE definition.  And there's an additional sanity check
	  to reject -k in that case.  The changes to use the library versions of
	  sched_setaffinity are protected by USE_KERNEL_SCHED_SETAFFINITY.  I
	  continue to go straight to the kernel on linux, though.

Tue Feb 11 2014 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Makefile: Reorganized Andrey Rahmatullin's changes a bit and used
	  them in my development build rules (make todd) too.

Tue Feb 11 2014 Andrey Rahmatullin <wrar@wrar.name>
	* Makefile: Honor CPPFLAGS, CFLAGS and LDFLAGS from the environment.

Mon Jan 27 2014 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Makefile: Change to my development build rules (make todd) to use ld's
	  --hash-style=both to avoid a SIGFPE when running on very old 32-bit
	  systems.  It has no effect on the tool for anyone else.

Thu Jan 23 2014 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Thu Jan 23 2014 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Stop displaying raw hex for 0xc and 0xe leaves, because they
	  are reserved and just contain zeroes.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed missing leaf 0xf subleaf 1 in do_real().
	* cpuid.man: Added reference to Intel Architecture Instruction Set
	  Extensions Programming Reference (319433).
	* cpuid.c: Added new feature flags from that document.

Sun Jan 12 2014 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>

	  engineering samples) and related Ivy Bridge-EP processors.
	* cpuid.c: Added Bay Trail (Atom Z3000, etc.) processors synth decoding.

Sun Jan 12 2014 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.man: Added reference to Intel decoding from Intel 64 and IA-32
	  Architectures Software Developer's Manual Volume 2A: Instruction Set
	  Reference, A-M (253666).
	* cpuid.c: Added new Intel decodings from that document.

Sun Jan 12 2014 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added new (instruction supported synth) field to report on
	  instruction support when knowledge of that is scattered across
	  multiple CPUID leaves.  PREFETCH/PREFETCHW is the weirdest example.
	* cpuid.c: Clarified the raw PREFETCH/PREFETCHW field in 80000001 edx
	  leaf with the 3DNow! prefix, similar to the description in the AMD
	  CPUID docs.  Thanks to Chris Orgill for reporting these two issues.

Fri Sep 27 2013 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added missing break to decode_amd_model(), family (0,15),
	  model (4,0), case 0x18.  Thanks to David Binderman for reporting this.

Mon Jun 10 2013 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Mon Jun 10 2013 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added mention of Opteron 3200 (Zurich) chips, accidentally
	  omitted from yesterday's updates.

Sun Jun  9 2013 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Sun Jun  9 2013 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Updated 14h Model 00h-0Fh AMD model tables.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for Opteron x300 (Piledriver) chips.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for family 16h processors, tentatively
	  identified as Steamroller.
	* cpuid.man: Added new AMD 15h Model 10h-1Fh, and AMD 16h Model 00h-0Fh
	  manuals.

Sat Jun  8 2013 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added sanity check to 0xCxxxxxxx leaves to check for an
	  unreasonably large indicated maximum leaf number.  If found, further
	  walk of them is halted.
	* cpuid.c: Skip 0x4xxxxxxx leaves if cpuid does not indicate that the
	  environment is a guest.  This was suggested by Steven Levine, although
	  I implemented it differently.

Sat Jun  8 2013 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Clarified some KVM hypervisor leaf feature flags that Eduardo
	  Habkost pointed out.  Added a couple new flags.

Sat Jun  8 2013 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Extended Eduardo Habkost's stash separation to include the
	  0x80000008 leaf, and the leaves that inform transmeta_info.

Sat Jun  8 2013 Eduardo Habkost <ehabkost@raisama.net>
	* cpuid.c: This patch separates the code that changes fields in the
	  'stash' struct from the code that prints that information. This way,
	  the stash struct will get updated even when in raw mode, so other
	  parts of the code can use that information.
	  [NOTE FROM Todd Allen: It used to be that the stash was only set and
	  used in cooked mode, but some uses dealing with the hypervisor snuck
	  out and were used all the time.  This new separation is only really
	  necessary for the hypervisor fields, but it's good practice to do all
	  the fields this way, so I'm accepting the patch as is.]

Sat Jun  8 2013 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for Celeron G400/G500.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for Cedarview B3.

	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for Ivy Bridge Pentium G1600/G2000/G2100.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for Ivy Bridge Pentium
	  900/1000/2000/2100.
	* cpuid.c: Clarified that Ivy Bridge Xeon E3-1200 is actually E3-1200 v2.
	* cpuid.c: Added vague synth decoding for Haswell, but spec updates
	  show no specific chips or steppings yet.
	* cpuid.c: Expanded A100/A110 synth decoding to include semi-official
	  Pentium M (Crofton) processors in Apple TV boxes.
	* cpuid.c: Added Xeon E5-2600 v2 engineering sample.  Perhaps this will
	  be the final synth decoding for them, but for now it's just marked as
	  an engineering sample.
	* cpuid.man: Added new Intel manuals.

Fri Aug 24 2012 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added sanity check to 0x4xxxxxxx leaves to check for an
	  unrecognized hypervisor and an unreasonably large indicated maximum
	  leaf number.  If found, further walk of them is halted.

Tue Aug 21 2012 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Cleaned up printf(name) statements that were admonished by
	  clang.

Fri Jun  1 2012 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Thu May 31 2012 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Updated CPUID feature flags.
	* cpuid.c: Updated CPUID function 7 to support sub-leaves (mostly for
	  future functionality that might be added to them).
	* cpuid.c: Updated synth decoding for Intel Dothan C0 because some use
	  65nm process now.
	* cpuid.c: Updated Intel EP80579 synth to mention 65nm process.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for Intel Atom E600 series.
	* cpuid.c: Updated synth decoding for Intel Sandy Bridge D2 to include J1
	  and Q0, which have the same CPUID.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for Intel Atom D2000/N2000 (Cedarview).
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for Intel Sandy Bridge-E.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for AMD Llano.
	* cpuid.c: Improved distinction between AMD Interlagos & Zambezi.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for RDC IAD 100.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed some formatting bugs for Transmeta-specific leaves.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for some of VIA's versions of WinChips.
	* cpuid.man: Added mentions of spec updates for several Atoms, i7 for
	  LGA-2011, and Xeon E5; and AMD 12h family.

Wed May 30 2012 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Fixed ancient bug in distinguishing Irwindale from Nocona
	  (they differ only by L2 cache size).
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for desktop and mobile Ivy Bridge.

Sat Feb 25 2012 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c: Cleaned up hypervisor-specific leaves for KVM.
	* cpuid.man: Added mention of KVM cpuid documentation.

Fri Feb 24 2012 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for Intel Westmere-EX processors.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for AMD family 15h chips: AMD FX
	  (Zambezi), Opteron 6200 (Interlagos), and Opteron 4200 (Valencia).
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for AMD Z-Series and other Fusion
	  chip ON-C0 steppings.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for Atom Z600 (Lincroft).
	* cpuid.c: Updated AMD model decoding for family 10h processors.
	* cpuid.man: Added mention of AMD family 14h and 15h documents, and
	  Intel Westmere-EX & Lincroft documents.
	* cpuid.man: Removed obsolete limitation about 0x8000001b.
	* cpuid.c: Added support for hypervisor leaves (0x4000000 and after).
	  Interpreted known generic leaves.  Interpreted hypervisor-specific
	  leaves for Xen (deduced from source, as no documentation on them
	  exists).  Interpreted hypervisor-specific leaves for KVM.  Interpreted
	  hypervisor-specific leaves for Microsoft.

Tue Jan  3 2012 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for Athlon 64 (Venice DH-E6) chips.

Wed Nov  2 2011 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added saw_4 and saw_b stash flags to deal with chips that
	  report 0xc codes but still omit 0xb codes.  This way, a maximum code
	  of 0xc no longer implies the presence of 0xb codes for things like
	  APIC decoding.

Mon Mar 28 2011 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added APIC synth decoding for AMD, deduced by analogy to Intel
	  code and the multiprocessor synth logic.

Mon Mar  7 2011 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added some decoding for VIA 0xc0000002 codes, based on
	  information from Juerg Haefliger.  Very incomplete because VIA
	  doesn't document their functions well.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed output of 0xc0000001 raw dump to conform to new style.

Sat Mar  5 2011 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Fri Mar  4 2011 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c,cpuid.man: Added Celeron T1000 series, previously missing.
	* cpuid.c,cpuid.man: Added Celeron Mobile P4000, U3000 series.
	* cpuid.c,cpuid.man: Added current Sandy Bridge processors.

Thu Mar  3 2011 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added detection of PCIDs & TSC-DEADLINE.
	* cpuid.c: Verified Mike Stroyan CPUID 2 cache meanings from Intel CPUID
	  document (241618-037).  Added 0x76 meaning.
	* cpuid.c: Added various new flags from Intel 241618-037.
	* cpuid.c,cpuid.man: Added AMD family 14h processors.
	* cpuid.c,cpuid.man: Updated Intel process id table, mostly as just
	  generalizations.

Tue Nov  9 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Update the usage() screen, since some of its -i and -1
	  comments are incorrect now.

Mon Oct  4 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c, cpuid.man: Added AMD Geode LX.
	* cpuid.c: Added NSC Geode GX2 and AMD Geode GX.
	* cpuid.c, cpuid.man: Added AMD Geode NX.

Sat Oct  2 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c,cpuid.man: Added Intel Atom N500.

Thu Sep 30 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c,cpuid.man: Added support for Intel Tolapai (SoC).
	* cpuid.c,cpuid.man: Added support for Intel Clarkdale chips from
	  specification update 323179.
	* cpuid.c: Generalized decode_amd_model by adding full brand tables for
	  AMD chips.  If a BIOS doesn't recognize a chip it writes
	  "model unknown" into its brand string via MSR's.
	  decode_override_brand detects that and uses the decode_amd_model brand
	  to differentiate CPUs.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected 80000001/ebx PkgType, BrandId, and str1 bit fields.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected problems with brand field decoding because its bit
	  field with differs from architecture to architecture.
	* cpuid.c: decode_amd_model: the partialmodel decrement special case
	  applies only to XF=1,F=15; and not to XF=2,F=15.

Mon Sep 27 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added support for NSC/AMD Geode GX1.

Wed Sep  8 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Corrected the Transmeta processor revisions, which should've
	  been in hex instead of octal.

Thu Sep  2 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added a couple vague steppings for Transmeta Efficeon TM8000
	  processors.  Updated some transmeta bitfields.  This is all done
	  blind, as I have no examples of these chips, little documentation, and
	  the company is long defunct.

Thu Sep  2 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed a few header strings that had incorrect function hex
	  codes or registers.

Wed Sep  1 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed buffer size in do_file() to be able to read new
	  raw dumps with ecx information.  It needed a couple more characters.
	* cpuid.c: Added Celeron M (Yonah D0) & Celeron M (Merom-L1 A1) synth
	  entries.
	* cpuid.c: added Xeon Processor LV (Sossaman D0).
	* cpuid.c: Update Itanium chips in the synth tables.  Sadly, this all
	  still is being done blind, as I have no access to any Itanium chips.
	* cpuid.c: Wrote an x86_64 counterpart to the assembly code for
	  bits_needed().
	* Makefile, cpuid.proto.spec: Changed to support building for both i386
	  and x86_64.

Tue Aug 31 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c: Rearranged synth rules and substantially simplified query
	  macros into something like the form I was hoping for when I started
	  this redesign.
	* cpuid.c: Added changes from the new AMD CPUID document that claims to
	  have been released in September 2010!
	* cpuid.c: Changed raw dump to include %ecx values to accomodate CPUID
	  functions with gaps in the useful %ecx range (e.g. 0xd).  The file
	  parser accepts either the old or new forms.
	* Makefile, cpuid.proto.spec: Updated build scheme for my current
	  systems.
	* LICENSE: Changed to a GPL license.

Mon Aug 30 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Semi-mechanically eliminated the codes used to
	  disambiguate in the synth string and replaced them with queries,
	  which I think will be more general-purpose and will allow me to
	  eliminate a lot of the problem with codes appropriate for one
	  model being a problem for subsequent models (e.g. the Core Solo
	  vs. Core Duo distinction).  There still are general-purpose
	  queries like there were general-purpose codes, but the
	  special-case queries will only matter for those families that
	  care about them.  This does mean that it's possible for multiple
	  queries to register as true, so I have to be more careful with
	  the order of chips in the synth tables.

Fri Aug 27 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Tested on a variety of CPUs.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected Mobile Turion checking in decode_brand.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth entries for 6/15/4 pre-production
	  Conroe B0/Woodcrest B0.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth entries for Santa Rosa F3 stepping
	  (undocumented).
	* cpuid.c: Fixed synth entries for Brisbane, Toledo, and Windsor to
	  expect code DA (for dual-core Athlons).
	* cpuid.c: Generalized the check for Intel Extreme Edition chips.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth entries Core 2 Quad (Conroe) chips.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth entry for VIA 6/13/0 chip.  Unfortunately, there
	  is no documentation and very little anecdotal evidence of this chip,
	  so the description is vague.
	* cpuid.c: Added addition CPUID function 2 cache codes from Mike
	  Stroyan.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed some cut&paste errors that had EAX where it should
	  have been EBX, as reported by Mike Stroyan
	* cpuid.c: Added very short synth table for SiS chips.  I found no
	  documentation on these, so I just have the one case.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed the (synth) strings for oddball chips, which suffered
	  from a cut&paste error.
	* cpuid.c: Simplified some of the fallback strings that had grown
	  ridiculously long.

Thu Aug 26 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Tested on a variety of CPUs.
	* cpuid.c: Added more logic for Woodcrest pre-production chips.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected synth logic for VIA Antaur chips.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth for plain vanilla Thoroughbred Athlon.

Wed Aug 25 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Tested on a variety of CPUs.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed a couple bugs with decoding processor numbers in
	  print_synth_amd_model.

Tue Aug 24 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Further changes to mp_synth decoding, including tracking
	  of the decoding method used (there are around 4 major approaches,
	  depending on how you count).
	* cpuid.c: Added apic_synth decoding to find the appropriate field
	  widths and decode the process local APIC physical ID.  This is useful
	  in its own right, but also helps convince me that many Intel chips
	  really do claim to have hyperthreads even though they don't.
	* cpuid.c: Added support for direct instruction (-i) functionality to
	  report on all CPUs by calling sched_setaffinity to reschedule the
	  process on each CPU.  This is now the default behavior for -i, but
	  it can be overridden with the -1 option.
	* cpuid.c: added Barcelona B1 (undocumented chip) synth decoding.

Mon Aug 23 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Made real_get pass the requested ecx values even when
	  using -k.  Modern linux kernel expect the ecx values in the upper
	  32 bits of the file offset (i.e. lseek64).
	* cpuid.c: Worked out a fallback for determining mp_synth information
	  for Intel chips which lack CPUID function 4.
	* cpuid.c: Added mechanism for determining mp_synth information from
	  CPUID function 11 information if it's available (because if it's
	  present on Intel chips, it's the only reliable way; the older
	  mechanisms return gibberish).

Fri Aug 20 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c, cpuid.man: Added to synth even more Nehalem chips.
	* cpuid.c: Added 6/15 model for VIA Nano, but there's very little
	  detailed information on this chip, so that's it.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected some AMD codename confusion from 2006:
	  Dublin->ClawHammer/Odessa, Sonora->Dublin,
	  Palermo(mobile)->Georgetown/Sonora, Lancaster->Lancaster/Richmond,
	  Richmond->Taylor/Trinidad.
	* cpuid.c: Overhauled the AMD model dumping code to understand new
	  families.
	* cpuid.c: Tweaked decode_mp_synth to use ApicIdCoreIdSize, per AMD's
	  CPUID recommendations.

Thu Aug 19 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c, cpuid.man: Updated synth tables for Intel Xeons.
	* cpuid.c: Removed all the "How to distinguish" comments, since
	  it seems to be very common for Intel to have indistinguishable
	  processors nowadays (the old cache-checking tricks are unreliable
	  now).
	* cpuid.c, cpuid.man: Added to synth additional Nehalem chips as I'm
	  able to hunt them down.

Wed Aug 18 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c, cpuid.man: Updated synth tables for Intel Core 2, Atom,
	  Celeron, and Pentium chips based on the same cores.

Tue Aug 17 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c, cpuid.man: Updated synth tables for AMD family 10h (K10)
	  and family 11h processors.
	* cpuid.c: simplified print_x_synth_amd by pruning its table down to
	  just the three families that differ from normal 1/eax simple synth,
	  and falling back on 1/eax simple synth otherwise.

Mon Aug 16 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added new steppings to synth tables using latest spec
	  updates for all AMD processor families already in them.
	* cpuid.c, cpuid.man: Updated synth tables for AMD family 0Fh (K8)
	  processors.

Fri Aug 13 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Updated raw data dump based on latest CPUID documentation
	  from Intel & AMD.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed dump of function 4 to iterate over all caches.

Thu Aug 12 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Reorganized synth tables to always use extended family
	  and extended model numbers since they are so prevalent on modern
	  chips.
	* cpuid.c: Added new steppings to synth tables using latest spec
	  updates for all Intel processor families already in them.

Sun Nov 26 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Recognize Intel Core 2 Extreme Edition from brand string.
	  Thanks to Tony Freitas for explaining that Ennnn means desktop while
	  Xnnnn means Extreme Edition for those processors.

Wed Nov 22 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Recognize Itanium2 Montecito C2.
	* cpuid.c: Recognize Intel Core 2 Duo Mobile (Conroe B2).
	* cpuid.c: Recognize Intel Quad-Core Xeon Processor 5300 (Woodcrest B3)
	  and Intel Core 2 Extreme Quad-Core Processor QX6700 (Woodcrest B3).
	* cpuid.c: Recognize Intel Celeron D Processor 36x (Cedar Mill D0).
	* cpuid.c: Distinguish Core 2 Duo from Core 2 Extreme Edition based on
	  presence or absence of hyperthreading.  Thanks to Tony Seacow for
	  providing output for numerous processors and the advice about
	  hyperthreading.

Thu Nov  2 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Changed "number of logical CPU cores - 1" to "number of CPU
	  cores - 1".

Sun Sep 17 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c: Made the cpuid instruction (-i, --inst options) the default.
	* cpuid.c: Added -k, --kernel option to cause the kernel module to be
	   used.
	* cpuid.c: Removed confusing CPU number from output when using
	  the cpuid instruction.
	* cpuid.man: Updated with new options.
	* cpuid.c, Makefile: Changed i386 _llseek kludge to workaround
	  offsets >= 0x80000000.  Now using -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 in the
	  Makefile instead.  This should allow the i386 cpuid to work on
	  an x86_64 system.
	* cpuid.c: Added knowledge of CPU modules to synthesized field: Tulsa,
	  Woodcrest B1 (pre-production)
	* cpuid.c: In synthesized model field, properly distinguish between
	  Intel Pentium D Processor 8x0 and Intel Pentium Extreme Edition
	  Processor 840 (both Smithfields).
	* cpuid.man: Added mention of new 7100 series spec updates.
	* cpuid.spec: Changed Copyright to License.

Thu Aug 23 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Removed unnecessary one_cpu argument from do_file.
	* cpuid.c: Added -v option to display version number.

Wed Aug 23 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Tue Aug 22 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c, cpuid.man: Added -i option to use the CPUID instruction
	  directly instead of the CPUID kernel module.
	* cpuid.c: Change Pentium Processor 9x0 to 9xx because of 9x5
	  processors.
	* cpuid.man: Updated information about determining synthesized model
	  information, and added information about determining synthesized
	  multiprocessor information.

Mon Aug  7 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.proto.spec: Change URL to cpuid-specific page.

Sun Aug  6 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Sat Aug  5 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added support for differentiating Core 2 Duo CPUs from Xeon
	  5100 CPUs based on the brand string.
	* cpuid.c: Clarified that CPUID 4 ECX contains one less than the
	  number of sets.
	* cpuid.c: Added support for CPUID 5 ecx & edx.
	* cpuid.c: Added support for CPUID 6 ecx.
	* cpuid.c: Added support for CPUID 0xa eax & ebx.
	* cpuid.c: Made CPUID functions 7, 8, and 9 reserved (i.e. say nothing
	  until and unless they are defined).
	* cpuid.c: Corrected CPUID 1 ecx xTPR disabnle.

Wed Aug  2 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>

	* cpuid.man: Mention wikipedia pages for CPUs.

Tue Aug  1 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: On help screen, clarified that -f option reads output from
	  -r option.
	* cpuid.proto.spec: Used %{} macros for external command invocations.

Mon Jul 31 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Makefile: Removed install -o 0 -g 0 options.  For installations
	  from the tarball, the user will have to be root anyway.  And for
	  rpm, the %defattr() attribute in the spec is handling this more
	  cleanly.  Finally, those options are causing some non-root
	  installations to have to be done by the root user, which is
	  undesirable.
	* cpuid.c: Improved identification for VIA C3 (Samuel WinChip C5A core).
	* cpuid.c: Loosened up check for "Mobile AMD Athlon(tm) XP" by
	  removing "-M" suffix.
	* cpuid.c: Recognize mobile Athlon XP (Thoroughbred).

Sun Jul 30 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed "deterministic cache parameters (4)", so that its
	  children aren't staggered.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected Venice and Palermo processors with DH-E3 and
	  DH-E6 steppings that had been reported as Toledo processors
	  incorrectly.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected codename for the Athlon Thoroughbred's Duron
	  counterpart: Applebred.
	* cpuid.c: Added code to distinguish Athlon XP Thortons from Bartons,
	  based on L2 cache size.
	* cpuid.c: Added code to distinguish Athlon 64 X2 Manchester E6 from
	  Athlon 64 X2 Toledo.
	* cpuid.c: Added Celeron Yonah C0.
	* cpuid.c: Added Core Yonah D0.
	* cpuid.c: Added Xeon Nocona R0 / Irwindale R0 stepping.
	* cpuid.c: Added Pentium 4 Cedar Mill C1, Pentium D Presler C1, and
	  Xeon Dempsey C1.
	* cpuid.c: Added Xeon Woodcrest B2.
	* cpuid.c: Added Core 2 Conroe B1 & B2 & Core 2 Extreme Processor B1 &
	  B2.
	* cpuid.c: Updated Itanium2 processors.
	* cpuid.man: Added Intel specification updates for new CPUs.

Wed Jul 26 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: In decode_brand, added check for "Athlon(TM) XP", equivalent
	  to "Athlon(tm) XP".
	* cpuid.c: Fixed "80000002" typo in print_80860002_eax().

Mon Jul 24 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Distinguish properly between Core Solo, Core Duo, and
	  Xeon Processor LV.  Reorganized multi-processor decoding to
	  support that.

Sun Jul 23 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Fixed emission of raw values for cpuid code 2.
	* cpuid.c: Added -f file option to read raw hexadecimal input from a
	  file and parse it instead of executing the cpuid instruction, and
	  code reorganization to support this.

Mon May 22 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Fixed "unrecogninzed" typo in error.

Fri Apr  7 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.proto.spec: Added %defattr so that the files in the rpm's are
	  owned by "root" and not "todd".  (Why did no one scream bloody murder
	  about this before?)

Mon Apr  3 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c: Added code to distinguish between the two different Dual-Core
	  Xeon (Paxville A0) and Dual-Core Xeon Processor 7000 (Paxville A0).
	  Empirically, the significant differences are the VMX flag and the
	  "execution disable" flag.  The VMX flag is in an Intel-defined
	  CPUID function, so it's used.  Thanks to Jason Nicholls for providing
	  the Dual-Core Xeon (Paxville A0) output that made this possible.
	* cpuid.c: Added detection for Xeon Processor LV (Sossaman C0).

Mon Mar 13 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed code that distinguished processors based on
	  presence or absence of L3 cache.  Some of the cache codes weren't
	  being recognized as L3 cache.

Sun Feb 26 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Wed Feb 22 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added VMX: virtual machine extensions to CPUID function 1,
	  register ecx.
	* cpuid.c: Added SVM LBR virtualization to CPUID function 8000000a,
	  register edx.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed cut & paste header error in print_8000000a_eax.

Tue Feb 21 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Renamed "hyper-threading technology" field to
	  "hyper-threading / multi-core supported" to eliminate some confusing
	  situations, such as Northwood chips which nominally support hyper-
	  threading, but where it is disabled in the chip; or where hyper-
	  threading is disabled in the BIOS; or AMD multi-core chips, which
	  indicate TRUE here, but all of which lack hyper-threading at present.
	* cpuid.c: Updated family 15 description, which had grown very stale.
	* cpuid.c: Generalized Intel Pentium D Processor 900 to 9x0.
	* cpuid.c: Added Processor Number info to Smithfield processors.

Wed Feb  8 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c: Use defined(i386) instead of __LONG_MAX__ to determine
	  whether or not it's necessary to use _llseek().  Fixes handling of
	  functions >= 2**31 on some build systems, like the one I used to
	  build the binary rpm.  (D'oh!)  And also indirectly affects the
	  (synth) field.
	* cpuid.c: Fix a busted error check in read_reg() that caused it to
	  return success if the read() failed and quiet was true.
	* LICENSE: Created LICENSE file (using content straight out of the
	  man page).

Tue Feb  7 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c: Correctly distinguish Egypt/Italy processors.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed minor problems in error checking in open_file().
	* cpuid.spec: Fixed bad Packager field.
	* cpuid.spec: Include ChangeLog.
	* cpuid.man: Added -r/--raw description.
	* cpuid.man: Clarified info used for (synth) field.
	* cpuid.man: Fixed version number & date.
	* Makefile: Reworked to make it easy for people other than me to build
	  and install.
	* cpuid.spec: Used new Makefile organization
	* Makefile: Fixed production of spec file so that it's possible to
	  rebuild with the srpm without having to specify %version and
	  %release.

Mon Feb  6 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Initial public release.
